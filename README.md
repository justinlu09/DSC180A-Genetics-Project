# DSC180A-B04-Group04 - Profiling of Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder in Postmortem

This project demonstrates how researchers used RNA-sequencing of dissected post-mortem tissues in 3 groups of 24 patients each with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and 24 controls. This will contain the instructions on how to use the code to extract from "srp073813" folder which will contain "SRRXXXXXXX.1" files which will contain information about RNA-sequencing reads of one patient from the 4 groups.
