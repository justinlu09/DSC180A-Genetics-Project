# Profiling of Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder in Postmortem

This project demonstrates how researchers used RNA-sequencing of dissected post-mortem tissues in 3 groups of 24 patients each with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and 24 controls. This will contain the instructions on how to use the code to extract from "srp073813" folder which will contain "SRRXXXXXXX.1" files which will be converted by a SRA toolkit, fastq-dump, which will convert these files into data which contains RNA-sequencing reads of the samples. 

## Running the project

## Building the project using `run.py`
* To get the "SRRXXXXXXX.1" files into a CSV so that we can extract these files using fastq-dump later on using the command: `run.py data`
